# QuickPods

QuickPods is a Windows 11 desktop application for controlling the default output volume and selecting, connecting, disconnecting, and making a paired Bluetooth audio device the default output from the taskbar.

The repository is currently in Phase 0. Product behavior is not implemented yet; this branch establishes the reproducible .NET 10 build and test foundation used by the technical spikes.

## Requirements

- Windows 11 x64
- .NET SDK 10.0.302 or a compatible patch in the same feature band

## Bootstrap validation

Run these commands from the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet restore QuickPods.sln
dotnet restore QuickPods.sln --locked-mode
dotnet format QuickPods.sln --verify-no-changes --no-restore --severity info
dotnet build QuickPods.sln -c Release --no-restore -warnaserror
dotnet test QuickPods.sln -c Release --no-build --no-restore --logger "trx;LogFilePrefix=quickpods" --results-directory TestResults -- RunConfiguration.TreatNoTestsAsError=true
```

QuickPods supports x64 only. The solution's `Any CPU` configuration is retained as a .NET CLI and Visual Studio compatibility alias; `Directory.Build.props` always selects the x64 target.
