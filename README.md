# QuickPods

QuickPods is a Windows 11 desktop application for controlling the default output volume and selecting, connecting, disconnecting, and making a paired Bluetooth audio device the default output from the taskbar.

Phases 0–4 are integrated. Phase 5A is building the daily-use product shell: the v2 Bluetooth selector, Core Audio volume controls, notification-area lifetime, user settings, startup registration, and structured diagnostics. Physical Bluetooth acceptance remains deliberately deferred to Issues #38 and #41 while development is performed through Remote Desktop. See the [Phase 0 decision](docs/validation/phase-0/decision.md), [Phase 5A architecture](docs/architecture/phase-5a-product-ui.md), and [Phase 5A validation](docs/validation/phase-5a/test-results.md).

## Requirements

- Windows 11 x64
- .NET SDK 10.0.302 or a compatible patch in the same feature band

## Bootstrap validation

Run these commands from the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet restore QuickPods.sln
dotnet restore QuickPods.sln --locked-mode
dotnet format QuickPods.sln --verify-no-changes --no-restore --severity warn
dotnet build QuickPods.sln -c Release --no-restore -warnaserror
dotnet test QuickPods.sln -c Release --no-build --no-restore --logger "trx;LogFilePrefix=quickpods" --results-directory TestResults -- RunConfiguration.TreatNoTestsAsError=true
```

QuickPods supports x64 only. The solution's `Any CPU` configuration is retained as a .NET CLI and Visual Studio compatibility alias; `Directory.Build.props` always selects the x64 target.
